# Chat  - React & NodeJs

### Objective

Build a real-time chat application

### Requirements

- Users can send messages and see them appear in the chat in real time (for example, in a different browser tab)
- Users must submit a username to join
- Users can see the entire message history after joining the chat
- You must use node.js, react; the rest of the stack is up to you

### Bonus points (pick and choose)

- Multiple chat rooms
- Persistent message history
- Typescript
- File attachments

### What's already in the project

We pre-installed some packages and added a few configs so you don't have to spend your time on it:

- express server
- socket.io with a working config
- basic react app
- webpack proxy config to prevent CORS errors
- typescript config for the server
- typescript, ts-node, nodemon installed

### Tips

- Build incrementally
- Avoid spending too much time on setup and tooling

### What we will pay attention to

- How you prioritize work considering the time limitation
- Tidiness, code structure and following best practices
- Your choice and usage of frameworks, libraries and tooling
